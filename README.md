# Bugger

This demo is my own version of Frogger where a little beetle has to try and jump across roads filled with fast cars.

## Getting started with sbt

Type `sbt` into you command line to enter the sbt console. There you will be presented with a welcome screen a list of useful commands.

You can also use `sbt runGame`, to compile and run the game immediately.
